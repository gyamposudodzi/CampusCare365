Background

One in four young people worldwide is in danger of adopting harmful behaviors and lifestyles, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) study. The rising trend of poor eating patterns among students, fueling an increase in obesity and related disorders, is a significant cause for concern.

ACHA (American College Health Association) research from 2017 found that most college students lead unhealthy lifestyles. According to the report, university students only sleep 6 hours per night, with over 60% falling short. This is significantly less than the 7-9 hours each night that is advised, which can result in various physical and mental health issues, such as lowered immunity, depression, and obesity. The study also revealed that over 80% of college students eat fast food at least once per week, with over 30% doing so more frequently than that. Fast food consumption at this high level has been associated with higher incidences of obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.

Additionally, despite being advised to exercise for at least 30 minutes daily to maintain excellent health, more than 50% of university students do not do so. University students now experience higher rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease due to this lack of physical activity and significant fast food intake.

Campus Care365 - StuHealth solves the problem of helping busy university students live healthier and balancing their academics by providing a convenient, confidential, and accessible platform for students to access services that improve their overall health and wellbeing. There is no existing website or demo for Campus365 -  StuHealth as its entire application design is still in progress. The primary users of Campus Care365 - StuHealth  are college students.
